# Mentors List for NU Hacks

The idea for this project is to make it easy for freshmen/underclassmen to
find upperclassmen and get help on a project or seek mentorship. Please add 
yourself if you wouldn't mind helping out some nerdy baby huskies.

(And you really shouldn't, because after all, we're CCIS, and we family.)

### Where do I shove my data?

The JSON file is in `_harp/_data.json`. Main guideline is to follow the existing examples.

Some things to note:
* Remember that strings need to be strings. stringy strings, everyone.
* You have to have a name, description, and lang and interest arrays.

### Outline of the Object

Just in case this isn't self-explanatory enough
 * Name: Is your full name.
 * desc: A short, informal bio.
 * github: Github username.
 * www: Your personal website's full URL. Full. This is getting shoved right into a link tag.
 * twitter: Just your twitter handle,
 * langs: An array of strings, representing the list of programming languages, frameworks, etc. that you'd be comfortable giving advice about.
 * interest: An array of strings, representing things you're interested in and would be willing to talk about.

 Aaaand that's all, ladies and gentlemen. If you've got questions or anything's not clear, file a bug report. Thanks!
